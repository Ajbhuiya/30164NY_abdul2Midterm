Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
To store, organize, retieve and also to update  information.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
cTraversing, Searching, Inserting, Deleting, Sorting, Merging, andTraversing.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
        1.Compiler Design
        2.Operating System
        3.Database Management System
        4.Statistical analysis package
        5.Numerical Analysis
        6.Graphics
        7.Artificial Intelligence
        8.Simulation

what is an Array?
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a same data type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
The length is defined in array while it is not in arrayList and array list is expandable

what is LinkedList?
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object and does not have indexes

How is an Array different from Linked List?
In array, each element is independent placed in index, no connection with previous element or with its location.
In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node.

what is queue?
A queue is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning of the queue.
It also follows a natural order

what is stack?
It is a collection that is based on the last in first out (LIFO) principle.example a stack of
plates.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO is First in first out, LIFO is last in first out

what is the order of complexity? To find this we can use big O notation. we are measuring time annd spavce.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
It's best to use the first element

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
It would be using comparison

what is tree in data structure?
A Tree is a non-linear data structure where data objects are organized in terms of
hierarchical relationship or position with collection of nodes.


what is graph in data structure?
A graph is an object consisting of a vertex set and an edge set. A graph is an object consisting of a vertex set and an edge set.


what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Hashtable is synchronized whereas hashmap is not. Hashtable does not allow null keys or values

What are the major data structures used in the following areas :
RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.

How HashMap works in java? HashMap in Java works on hashing principle.HashMap internally stores mapping in the form of Map. Entry object which contains both key and value object
HashMap implementation calls hashCode method on Key object and applies returned hashcode into its own hashing function to find a bucket location for storing Entry object, important point to mention is that HashMap in Java stores both key and value.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
indicate that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
        1. Manually .Arrays.copyOf()  2-System.arraycopy() 3-Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location. In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node.

What is DFS and BFS?
DFS stands for Depth First Search. 2. BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is
called as recursive function.Recursion is method calls itself to solve some problem.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
When data items are not organized sequentially is called linear data structure, where data items are not organized sequentially is called non linear data structure.

What is Big-(O)-notation?Big O Notation is the language we use to describe the complexity
of an algorithm. Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Selection sort, Merge sort, Heapsort, Quicksort, Bubble sort, Shellsort, Comb sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
